# Tikkie Person Microservices - Serverless (AWS, Lambda, Serverless, Microservices, DynamoDb)


### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

### Local development

It is also possible to emulate DynamoDB, API Gateway and Lambda locally using the `serverless-dynamodb-local` and `serverless-offline` plugins. In order to do that, run:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-dynamodb-local
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add both plugins to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`. Make sure that `serverless-offline` is listed as last plugin in `plugins` section:

```
plugins:
  - serverless-dynamodb-local
  - serverless-offline
```

You should also add the following config to `custom` section in `serverless.yml`:

```
custom:
  (...)
  dynamodb:
    start:
      migrate: true
    stages:
      - dev
```

Additionally, we need to reconfigure `AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient` to connect to our local instance of DynamoDB. We can take advantage of `IS_OFFLINE` environment variable set by `serverless-offline` plugin and replace:

```javascript
const dynamoDbClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
```

with the following:

```javascript
const dynamoDbClientParams = {};
if (process.env.IS_OFFLINE) {
  dynamoDbClientParams.region = 'localhost'
  dynamoDbClientParams.endpoint = 'http://localhost:8000'
}
const dynamoDbClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient(dynamoDbClientParams);
```

After that, running the following command with start both local API Gateway emulator as well as local instance of emulated DynamoDB:

```bash
serverless offline start
```
